### CPSC 120

* Lab 12

    Lab 12, part 1 was a favorite because I had a great partner to work with for the project. The colors were also really fun and interesting to play around with. And at the end we had an image with many different colors that constantly were changing.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11, part 1 was also a favorite because, again, I had a really good partner to work with for the lab. We had to loop through the pizzas to find the pizza with the highest and lowest price-per-2000 calories. Also by doing this lab I felt as if I undertsood coding a lot more.

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, I felt as if was one of my favorites because of how important it was for us to learn. So we knew how to use commands and how to clone repositories. As well as learning how to upload our code to github.
